/**
 * @fileoverview In many programming languages, namespacing is a technique 
 * employed to avoid collisions with other objects or variables in the global 
 * namespace. They're also extremely useful for helping organize blocks of 
 * functionality in your application into easily manageable groups that can be 
 * uniquely identified.
